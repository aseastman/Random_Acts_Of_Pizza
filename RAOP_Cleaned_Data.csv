I have to admit I browse more than I make actual responses because I usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.           \n\nSo today I find myself with nothing important to do. I slept in cleaned up the place went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.         \n\nI would greatly appreciate something random and delicious since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight.

"," So yeah... employer just told me to be packed up and out of here in two weeks this past Friday.  I'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that I couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  My job has no benefits and I couldn't afford to go to the doctor so I manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...  \n  \nNow my power internet(which I'm downgrading soon) and TV service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone) cell phone bills(on contract so nothing I can do here) are all late.  I've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  I can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due and if I don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  I also need gas and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  And I have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that I haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so I'm just hurting her.\n  \nI live alone and haven't really made many friends since I moved to this state.  I've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  Now I'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.  \n  \nI'm subsisting on Ramen buttered pasta the cheapest hot dogs I can find and any other sale items I can find for less than $1 per dinner around .50-.75 for lunch and I don't even eat breakfast.  \n  \nBefore the troubles started I loved that new Dominos pan pizza.

He's been a godsend to me he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.\n\nHe's been sweating some bills due this week but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last now that's a friend.\n\nHe's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting plus pay for the cab ride so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge so that's what I wanna do.\n\nAnyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job but he could use this right now I know he could. So pretty please will someone help me make this man's day?\n\nI don't have many friends and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life.

My grandparents put everything they had into that store and it makes me sick to know that it's gone. Depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.\n\nI have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society but after 6 months of no work I am quickly losing hope. The one thing I have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza. No matter how I dress up these minute noodles the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. I'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please. I don't know exactly how this works but I've been reading and I'm intrigued. Some pizza could definitely cheer me up. Thank you.

I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year and trying to make my way through college things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However if someone could help a brother out I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to \pay-it-back\ to others who need help when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).\n\n\n\n**UPDATE"," Hey Reddit I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year and trying to make my way through college things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However if someone could help a brother out I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to \pay-it-back\ to others who need help when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).\n\n\n\n**UPDATE"," [REQUEST] Sydney student going through rough patch.

No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.  I would like to request that someone or some people would provide pizzas for a meal for the homeless. 10 pizzas would be enough. If anyone would like to help you can find the shelter's website at beshelter.org. It would make alot of someone very happy!

Then one day When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see I knew that this warrant was a possibility But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go With no ticket Not even a court date.

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us since the house is already empty we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier awesome right? So last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \resealing\ our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.

Sorry for not posting the state in the title guys.\n\nIf this sub is anything like the rest of Reddit I might get a little sympathy for being a total idiot my entire life. To make a long story short I was born in Salt Lake so I was branded LDS from conception. My 21st birthday party was a trip to temple to hear president Hinckley (our \Prophet\ at the time) speak about family. Even then I thought that was a lousy birthday. Up until yesterday I held priesthood in the church and was a key toting card carrying member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nThat is no longer the case I got up in the middle of sacrament on Sunday and after a less than friendly chat with our Bishop yesterday I am officially done with religion. I've been on the ropes for years but the cowpies just got stacked one too high lately. So I've had enough. If God exists he certainly doesn't look well upon the LDS followings. You know how much garbage I caught for buying a cup of coffee on Sunday? Way too much. For one thing caffeine is a no no but another lesser known of my former beliefs is we're not supposed to do anything business related on the Sabbath day. No dining out no work no grocery shopping etc. And the fact that I bought something turned almost the whole congregation on me. That was some good coffee too.\n\nSo basically I've spent 28 years trying hard to believe in something spent 2 years in Japan trying to make other people believe it with me and now I'm pretty much alone because of my refusal to believe in the most ridiculous things our church kept pushing on me. I got 2 friends who aren't LDS the others won't stick with me after renouncing their religion so I'm in the market for new friends to boot lol.\n\nIf you have any questions about the spooky and mysterious world of Mormonism ask away. And if you could spare some dinner for a guy who's tax check hasn't arrived yet you'd have my blessing and gratitude. And no not a religious kind of blessing. More like a walk tall and drink lots of water kinda blessing lol. Hope you're all having a nice day and thanks for reading.

Essentially they've left us downstairs post several joints and we have absolutely no food and a tremendous burning desire for it.\n\nWe're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up as this would be seriously uncool whilst high and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.\n\nThank you.

I liked my 9 dollars an hour then they fired me for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up there's a way around almost anything lol.\n\nI've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month sold all my worldly possessions I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that I dunno I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.\n\nMy family's been real supportive through all this my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all I've always managed on my own so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz gotta water the grass ya know?\n\nSince I got fired I don't get unemployment and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office line was already a hundred people long when I got their 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.\n\nSo that's some of it if I got into all of it we'd be here all day.

My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th 2011) due to colon cancer at the young age of 55 sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either he is an alcoholic anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him to help him with bills and whatnot and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always telling us that we're no longer welcome telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a \dick\  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway but he did. He slammed the door open knocking over Ana's desktop computer knocking over the desk it was set up on and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out much to Ana's dismay she was crying and screaming at him the whole time telling him to stop and let me go trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero she really is she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far thank you so much.\n\nBut alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact we still haven't paid our security deposit luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food hands down.
